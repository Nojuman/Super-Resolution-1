# Super-Resolution

In this repository, I implemented SRGAN for MNIST dataset.

There are four modes : 
* MSE 
* GAN 
* WGAN
* visual (plot the generated HR images given trained model)

See images folder for examples of generated images.

To be done :
* full-sized networks
* VGG loss
* benchmark on different sets
