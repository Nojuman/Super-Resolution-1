## Super-Resolution

In this repository, I implemented SRGAN for MNIST dataset.

### There are four modes : 
* MSE 
* GAN 
* WGAN
* visual (plot the generated HR images given trained model)

### More works
* See images folder for examples of generated images.
* See SR-CIFAR for network on CIFAR10
* See SR-FULL for full version of SRGAN

### To be done :
- [x] plot outputs by different networks together
- [x] full-sized networks
- [ ] VGG loss
- [ ] benchmark on different sets
